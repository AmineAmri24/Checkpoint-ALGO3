# Checkpoint-ALGO3

This aim of this algorithm is to sort the array of integer in order. SO for this reason we will set two counters i and j. We will check the content of the array two by two. in case we found an element j is superior than element j+1 the switch will be preformed, elso the counters will keep rolling.
at the end we will have a sorted array.
